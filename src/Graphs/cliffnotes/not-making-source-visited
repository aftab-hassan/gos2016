If source is not made visited

1. DFS - It's fine, it will only take the shortest path
2. BFS using 2 queues - it's fine
3. BFS using 1 queue - not fine, it will update distance
   0<->1 2
   -----/
   Basically connection from 0 to 1, 1 to 0, and 0 to 2.
  It will update distance from 0-0 to be 1. And then 0-2, will be 1+1 == 2. In reality, it's 0+1 == 1
  
Summary : Always make source to be visited
Marking the source as not visited at the start, is not a problem mostly. Only becomes a problem when two nodes
which depend on each other are both marked unvisited, which would cause it to form a cycle.
