I think if you want to find min hops, either BFS or DFS is equally good.

This problem can be done using either BFS or DFS

1. In case of BFS, you don't need any DP, because, even if you encounter a previous state

1 -> 2 -  >  3
^           /
\---------</

there is no way that, that would be lesser hops than the one already recorded.

2. In case of DFS, DP would've been useful, but you can't do DP because nodes are interdependent on each other.
So DFS with DP won't work, but plain DFS will surely work.

That brings us, to the only remaining point of discussion, which is DFS vs BFS.
For that there's no reason to use BFS over DFS, open to discussion.
