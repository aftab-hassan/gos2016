/*
 * Given a string like
 * aaabcdef
 * 
 * Compress like
 * a3bcdef
 * 
 * Caveats
 * 1. a1 and a2 are not helpful, so just a and aa would suffice
 * 2. Remember, what's tricky is that, if you have the count to be 15, then you should convert it to 
 * '1''5', but while converting the count%10, count/10 gives you in reverse order as '5''1'
