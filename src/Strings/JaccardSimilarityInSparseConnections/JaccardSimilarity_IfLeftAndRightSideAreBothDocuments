In the above question, you are given like
Docs    Integers
d1   -> 1, 2, 3
d2   -> 2,3
d3   -> 1,3,5

But what if you are given like
Docs -> Docs
d1   -> d2, d3, d4
d2   -> d1, d3
d3   -> d4
Then how will you find the connected components
A : This is exactly what a graph is. Just do BFS, that is all.
